            <h2>A little something about my self</h2>
            <p>Let me just be frank, I don't know what to write. But my discription would be something quite simple.
                What I would say is that, I'm currently 17, staying in Kumasi but from Elmina. I like to do a lot because of my curious mind. I just do everything I can get my hands on. 
                I like reading, gaming  basically anything interesting to keep my mind busy
            </p>


            <h2>My course and my reason behing it</h2>
            <p>I offer Computer Engineering </p>
            <p>The reason behind me choosing this program is due to a lot of factors.
                Since I said That I would be frank, I would say that it suited the conditions that my situation presents.
                Me wanting computer Science since I developed an interest and my parents wanting me to study Electrical Engineering because of it's diverse opportunities.
                I just chose what was the best of both worlds and I am happy i did that.
