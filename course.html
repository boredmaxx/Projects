        <p>This is the course I find myself to be reading. To be honest this wasn't the course I wanted.
            What I wanted was Computer Science initially but by God's grace and the art of pursuation from my parents I find myself here.
            I didn't like the idea at first but as I came, I enjoy it even with all the stress that comes with it. I will take it as a 
            challenge and hopefully I pull through.
